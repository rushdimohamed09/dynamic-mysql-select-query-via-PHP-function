# mysql-select-query-with-dynamic-WHERE-clause via PHP prepared statement function with JSON format
This is a dynamic single table mysql select query that is developed from PHP using prepared statements using AND operator and below steps will helps to return the value. This will output "Result found" if the the search criteria matches else it will return 'Result not found" and if wrong content was provided to the function it will return "Something went wrong"

1. Change the db_name on the config file
2. This is a function used with a single parameter. 
3. The parameter need to be in JSON format.
4. Set the table name, a table_column to check if the value is exisitng and finally the search criterias need to be include in the JSON request.
5. Hope this will help coding.
